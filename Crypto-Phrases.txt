we are all gonna die but I have a helmet
for sure there is nothing to lose but something to gain
to be happy stop existing and start living
my mom said that I am cool because I do not do drugs
love your enemies it makes them angry
mountains are always there to be climbed
the best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today
it is better to look stupid and keep your mouth closed than to open it and prove it
never let your emotions decide your destination
two heads are better than one unless they are on the same body
she advised him to give up smoking but he would not listen to her
when everything is coming your way you are in the wrong lane
astronauts can never play football because they can not even kick a ball
doing your best today is the best way to prepare for tomorrow
you will always complain about your life until you see people who go through worse times
viewers were stunned by the emotionality of the reunion
please try to sound like yourself for once
